# DelphiWebScript Project #

DWScript is an object-oriented scripting engine for Delphi based on the [Delphi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarcadero_Delphi) language, with extensions borrowed from other Pascal languages ([FreePascal](http://www.freepascal.org/), [Prism](http://prismwiki.codegear.com/en/Main_Page), etc.). It introduces a few Pascal language extensions of its own as well.

Goals of the project go beyond web usages, and cover general purpose scripting.

To get started see FirstSteps or [Language], for news see the [posts tagged "DWS"](http://delphitools.info/tag/dws/) at [DelphiTools.info](http://delphitools.info/). You can also have a look at the [FAQ]. If you have other questions related to DWScript programming, usage or integration, [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/dwscript) is a good place to ask them.

This project is currently maintained by Eric Grange (http://delphitools.info), and sponsored by [Creative IT](http://creative-it.net), it is based on original DWS2 by Matthias Ackermann (http://sourceforge.net/projects/dws/) initiated way back in the last century.

DWScript lead platform is currently Delphi 10.3, compatibility with older Delphi version is not officially maintained, it may work, or it may not.
